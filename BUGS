 - If the page is refreshed, Firefox will automatically refill in the form with
the previous values, which means if anything has the default text, it will be
filled in and we'll think that it's the "user" filling it in by hand. One way
around this is to turn the text field into a hidden field and have it
automatically filled from a visible dummy field. That's a lot of work. Can't we
hang an event on a page refresh?
